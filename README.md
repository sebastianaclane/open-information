# Open Information Website

For this project I was hired as a subcontractor by Bizont, a web development company, to work on the Yukon Government Open Information Drupal 7 website. I completed various tasks such as creating the views, search filters, content types and the navigation.

The code I added in this GitHub repo is the "Open Data/Information Page Search" custom module I created. It adds the content type search filter of open data or open information when using the search box on either the Open Data or Open Information pages on the website.

Worth nothing that the open_data_information_search module in the production site would be in a directory structure like this: **rootdirectory/sites/all/modules/custom/open_data_information_search**
